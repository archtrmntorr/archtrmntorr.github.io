Let's dive into a PHP code review challenge from [TryCrack.ME](https://trycrack.me/) and elevate our skills stats.

- The purpose of this review is to go through the PHP code provided for the **Replace** challenge from _TryCrack.Me_ and to solve the challenge effectively. We will break down the code, understand its functionality, and then proceed with solving the problem.

<span style="color: PaleGreen;"><b>Here is Our **Code**.....</b></span>


```php
$your_input = "";

$txt = str_replace("op","",$your_input);

if($txt === "reprop")
  echo ("Good job!");
else
  echo ("Wrong Answer!");  
```

This PHP code review challenge involves manipulating the input string and performing a conditional check based on the string transformation. Let’s go step by step to understand what the code is doing.

### <span style="color: orange;"><b>What Does Code Says.........</b></span>

1 . <span style="color: PaleGreen;">**Initializing**</span>`$your_input`**:

```
$your_input = "";
```

- The variable `$your_input` is initialized as an empty string, but it will hold the input given by the user.
- For this challenge, the user would typically provide some input here.

2 . <span style="color: PaleGreen;">**Using `str_replace()`**:</span>

```
$txt = str_replace("op", "", $your_input);
```

- **`str_replace()`**: This PHP function replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string.
    - In this case, the substring `"op"` is being replaced with an empty string `""`.
    - The result of this replacement is stored in the variable `$txt`.

3 . <span style="color: PaleGreen;"> **The `if` Condition** </span>

```
if($txt === "reprop")
```

- After modifying `$your_input` with `str_replace()`, the code checks whether the resulting string `$txt` is exactly equal to `"reprop"`.
-  exactly equal to operator   is the strict equality operator, which checks both value and type. In this case, the check is for an exact match of the string `"reprop"`.

4. <span style="color: DarkSalmon;"> **Output**:</span>

```
echo ("Good job!");
```

- If the modified input `$txt` matches the string `"reprop"`, the message `"Good job!"` is displayed.

```
echo ("Wrong Answer!");
```

 - If the modified input `$txt` does **not** match `"reprop"`, the message `"Wrong Answer!"` is displayed.

### <span style="color: Orange;">**Key Point :**</span>

- The transformation involves **removing all occurrences of `"op"`** from the input string. The challenge requires the user to input a string that, **after removing `"op"`, results in `"reprop"`**.
####  <span style="color: PaleGreen;">Walkthrough:</span>

- Let's find the original input that results in `"reprop"` after removing `"op"`.
    
    1. The code expects the output `$txt` to be `"reprop"`.
    2. Adding `"op"` at strategic places in `"reprop"` should give us the input that will pass the condition.
    
    If we insert `"op"` back into `"reprop"`, we get `"reproopp"`.
    
    So, the correct input for this challenge would be:

```
$your_input = "reproopp";
```

### <span style="color: Orange;">**Explanation of Input:**</span>

- If you input `"reproopp"`, the `str_replace()` function will remove the `"op"` substrings:
    - **`str_replace("op", "", "reproopp")`** results in `"reprop"`.
    - Since this matches the expected value in the `if` condition, the script will output `"Good job!"`.

### <span style="color: PaleGreen;">**Summary :**</span>

- The challenge involves providing an input where, after removing `"op"`, the string becomes `"reprop"`.
- The correct input to pass the challenge is `"reproopp"`.
